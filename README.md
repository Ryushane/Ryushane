### Hi there 👋

I'm Shane, a graduate student at BUAA.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on low resource utilization accelerator for CNN Training.

### 📷 My Website
- I update my note on this blog, and show some photographs which I take.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I am a part-time uploader on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/3882240). I'd like to create some review of digital product and vlog of my daily life.
